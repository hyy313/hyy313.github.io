I am studying for a master's degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. At present, I am mainly researching the direction of RISV convolutional neural network accelerator, and I am also engaged in related research work on RISCV and LLVM.

Here is a space to record my coding time! If I can help you, I will be very honored. You can discuss with me in the issue under this reposity.
